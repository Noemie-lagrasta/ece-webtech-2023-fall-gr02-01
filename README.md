## Miscellaneous

### Course Feedback

The great thing about this course is that it's a constant improvement on the previous lab. Over the course of the labs, we could really see our web application improving and taking shape like the ones we were working on.
We found that the teachers knew how to answer all our questions, whether it was the lectures or the physical classes: they were all comprehensive.
One of the real pluses was the use of github and its organization.
Indeed, course content could be found in the indexes of each module.

### Project Reuse

- [x] We authorize the professors to use our project as an example for the next year students (facultative).
